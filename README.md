# Wireframer

> A wireframing / ui tool for mocking web-based applications.


## Description

Wireframer is self-hosted Javascript application written in [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/). All data generated by the application is stored in the browser's localstorage. This project was inspired by [Mockup Designer](https://github.com/fatiherikli/mockup-designer).
